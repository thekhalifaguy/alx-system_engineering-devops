When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, several steps occur to retrieve and display the Google homepage:

DNS Resolution: The domain name "google.com" needs to be translated into an IP address that servers can use to locate the website. This process is called DNS (Domain Name System) resolution. Your computer sends a request to a DNS server to obtain the IP address associated with "google.com."

HTTP Request: Once the IP address is obtained, your browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the Google server at that IP address. The request typically asks for the default webpage or the specific webpage associated with the root URL ("/").

Server Processing: Google's server processes the request. It may involve various tasks like checking for the requested page, executing any server-side scripts, and gathering the necessary resources.

Response: The server then sends an HTTP response back to your browser. This response includes the HTML code for the Google homepage, along with additional resources such as CSS files, JavaScript, images, etc.

Rendering: Your browser receives the response and starts rendering the webpage. It interprets the HTML code, applies styles from CSS, executes JavaScript, and displays the content on your screen.

Additional Requests: The webpage might include references to other resources (e.g., images, stylesheets, scripts) that are hosted on different servers or locations. Your browser sends additional requests to retrieve these resources.

Display: Finally, your browser displays the fully-rendered Google homepage, and you can interact with it by entering search queries or navigating through the links and features on the page.

The entire process happens quickly, and modern browsers are optimized to load and render webpages efficiently. Keep in mind that websites may use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt the data exchanged between your browser and the server, providing a more secure connection.
